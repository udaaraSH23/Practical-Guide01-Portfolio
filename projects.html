            <h2>Flood Prediction and Warning System</h2>
            <p>
              The Flood Alert App is a user-friendly mobile application designed
              to provide timely alerts and essential information during flood
              emergencies. Developed as a creative design group project in the
              second year, second semester, this app integrates real-time water
              level monitoring, emergency contact features, and sensor
              technology for effective flood management. This App ensures user
              safety with several critical features. Real-time alerts provide
              instant notifications when water levels exceed safe limits,
              prompting timely precautions. User registration allows users to
              register their mobile numbers and locations to receive localized
              alerts. The emergency contacts feature offers quick access to
              important numbers, including local authorities and rescue
              services. Additionally, sensor integration connects with deployed
              sensors in flood-prone areas, delivering real-time water level
              data directly to the app for the most current updates.
